# Recommender-system-atelier-IA-
In this work we present the implementation of an approach based on active learning used in collaborative filtering 
to suggest movies to a new user. We proceed with two layers, the first will use the active learning approach to select 
the first films to be evaluated by the user when registering, and in the second layer we will use the recursive 
prediction algorithm applied to nearrest-neighbor based collaborative filtering to predict the rating of the movies by 
the active user (new user) and suggest the highest ones. The data set used is from [MovieLens], a movie recommendation service.
